KTM 450,Race Ready KTM 505sxUp for sale is a KTM 505sx atv. Quad was rebuilt in January 2017 for the 2017 race season. Just hit 25 hours and swapped the piston to keep motor fresh. Oil and filters are changed after every practice and race. I recently got a really good job that has long hours so I will have no time to keep racing. I also have almost enough parts to build another quad. I can deliver up to 2 hours away. Can ship but at your cost.
